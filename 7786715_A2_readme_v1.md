# Title: How to Host a Resume on Github Pages using VSCode and Jekyll

## Purpose

Additionally, this guide will teach you some of Etter's key principals in technical communication, namely:      

1. Use a lightweight markup language
2. Format a document with a static site generator
3. Share/host documents on a distributed version control system.

At the end of this guide, you will have a hosted resume that looks like the one shown below:
